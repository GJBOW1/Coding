<!-- CSS Notes (Cascading Style Sheets) -->

Class, ID, and Important

Selecting a class:
Another way we can select a tag is by its class. In the HTML we can add a class 
attribute with the name of the class we want to select (class names cannot 
contain a space, spaces are used to separate multiple classes).

<p class="is-centered">This text should be center aligned</p>
<p>This text should remain left-aligned</p>
<p class="is-red">This text should be red</p>

In the css we can then select a class by using a . followed by the class name.

.is-centered {
    text-align: center;
}
.is-red {
    color: red;
}

Classes are incredibly flexible and we will encourage you to use them frequently. 
Classes are allowed to be applied to multiple elements even if they aren't the 
same type. We can also apply more than one class at a time to an element if we 
so choose.

Selecting an id:
Sometimes there only needs to be one of a given element, in those cases we can use id as well.

<div id="game">
    <img id="player" src="walk-animation.gif" alt="player sprite">
</div>

In the css we can then select an id by using a # followed by the class name.

#game {
    width: 320px;
    height: 240px;
    overflow: hidden;
    background: linear-gradient(#1293f5, #bae8ff 80%, #35b236 80%);
}
#player {
    margin-top: 140px;
    margin-left: 50px;
}
/* Don't worry about knowing what all of these properties are yet */
/* we'll come back to them later, we promise! */


In the example above, we should only ever have one #game field and one #player in the scene at a time. So id 
will be a fine choice here. If we decided to add a second player we'd need to give it a unique id.

In general we'll find that classes can encourage us to reuse our code (a good thing) and are more flexible. 
So unless we really need to know an element is unique we should use classes for now.


The Wildcard *:
If you ever want to select all the elements, the wildcard selector can do just that.
* {
    outline: 1px solid red;
}
The above code will draw a red outline around every element on the page which is really useful when we start 
to work on positioning elements where we want them on the page.

Selector Specificity:
There is a hierarchy of priority when using class and ID. class is the lowest priority, ID is the second most 
important, then it's !important as the most important priority. If you have contradictory style mandates
in your style.css file, the code will choose the mandate with the greatest priority. 
You can set a priority level by using z-index: put number here

What would happen if we were to have the following HTML and CSS?

<h1 id="red" class="green">Hello World</h1>
h1 {
    color: rebeccapurple;
}
.green {
    color: mediumseagreen;
}
#red {
    color: tomato;
}
The h1 selector wants to make the tag rebeccapurple, the class wants to make the tag mediumseagreen and the 
id wants to make the tag tomato. Which color will it actually be?
The answer is that the tag will be "tomato".

In rough terms, selecting a tag like h1 or p has a strength like 1, selecting a class like .green has a strength 
like 10, and selecting an id like #red has a strength like 100. So ids will be stronger than classes which will 
be stronger than elements. If we're wondering about the wildcard selector *, it has a strength like 0.1.

Descendant Selector:
Sometimes we know the element we want to select is inside of another element. If the "parent" element is one we 
can easily select (maybe it has a class on it), then we can use this to our advantage to access the child element 
easily.

<p>This is a quote about CSS</p>
<div class="quote">
    <p>"CSS is like chess. You learn the basics in a day and spend a lifetime mastering it."</p>
</div>
<p>Chris Coyier (css-tricks.com)</p>

.quote p {
    color: darkslategrey;
    font-style: italic;
}

If we want to select the paragraph that is inside of the "quote" class and not the paragraphs that are outside of 
the "quote" we can use a space in our selector between the parent element and the child we want to select. This 
can save us from having to make additional classes to select just the element we want.

Direct Descendant Selector:
Similar to the Descendant Selector, we can select a child element with the Direct Descendant Selector `>`, 
but unlike the Descendant Selector it won't select grandchildren.

<div class="header">
    <img src="brand-img.png" alt="brand image">
    <a href="#">Home</a>
    <a href="#">About</a>
    <a href="#" class="cart">
        <img src="cart.png" alt="cart-icon">
        <span>Cart (2)</span>
    </a>
</div>

.header > img {
    height: 50px;
}

In the above example, the brand image will be given a height of 50px and the cart icon won't be affected.

Combining Selectors: 
We talked earlier about selector specificity and mentioned how id has a relative strength like 100. 
We can actually make even stronger selectors by combining them. If we write a selector like div#game p.score 
(select a paragraph with the class "score" that is a child of a div with the id "game") it will have a strength 
like 112.

selector | strength
-------------------
div      | +1
#game    | +100
p        | +1
.score   | +10
-------------------
combined | 112

Attribute Selector:
Sometimes we have a situation where we want to style two similar elements that rely on an attribute for how they 
behave. For instance if we are making a form we likely use `<input type="text">` for the user to input data into 
and `<input type="submit">` which acts as the button the user clicks to submit the form. CSS we would want to use 
on one we might not want to use on the other. While we *could* use a class to differentiate between the two we 
could also use a selector that looks at the attribute.

<form action="/process" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="username" value="Rebecca">
    <input type="submit" value="Enter Username">
</form>

input {
    padding: 5px;
    border-color: rebeccapurple;
}
input[type="text"] {
    border: none;
    border-bottom: 2px solid rebeccapurple;
}
input[type="submit"] {
    color: white;
    background-color: rebeccapurple;
}

We can apply some styles to both inputs using the `input` selector and follow up with attribute selectors to 
style the text input and submit button differently.

CSS Properties - Color:

Named colors -
We can see a full list here

black
white
red
green
blue
magenta

RGB -
Each number must be between 0 and 255 and they are set for red, green, and blue respectively.

rgb(0,0,0)
rgb(255,255,255)
rgb(255,0,0)
rgb(0,128,0)
rgb(0,0,255)
rgb(255,0,255)

Hexadecimal -
Hexadecimal works very similarly to rgb with each pair of numbers/letters representing the red, green, and blue respectively.

#000000
#ffffff
#ff0000
#008000
#0000ff
#ff00ff

We can think of hexadecimal like switching to letters when we run out of numbers, in hexadecimal
are all valid values for 0 through 15. The hexadecimal number FF when expressed in decimal (base 10) is 255.
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f


Color vs Background Color:
When we apply CSS we need to keep in mind that color changes the color of text, and background-color changes the 
color in the background of whatever element we have selected

<h1>Coding Dojo</h1>

h1 {
  color: cyan;
  background-color: grey;
}

Background color can be applied to a multitude of elements (body, div, thead, etc...), not just ones obviously 
containing text.

Text Alignment:
We can adjust the text alignment using text-align.
text-align: left;
text-align: center;
text-align: right;

Text Decoration / font style / font weight:
We can apply (or remove) an underline to text using the text-decoration property

text-decoration: underline;
text-decoration: line-through;
text-decoration: none;

We can apply or remove italics using font-style:
font-style: italic;
font-style: normal;

We can make text bold or narrow with font-weight
font-weight: normal;
font-weight: light;
font-weight: bold;
The font-weight property also accepts number values: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900
Note that font-weight will only be applied if the font-family contains styles for it

Font Family:
There is a lot to know about fonts, but for now let's focus on the basic types: serif, sans-serif, 
monospace, and cursive.
font-family: serif;
font-family: sans-serif;
font-family: monospace;
font-family: cursive;

Sizes:
Below are some of the most common styling properties that will affect all elements. This is not a definitive list 
and you should try doing a search for other properties that can help you to add style to your documents.

width | height:
The width and height properties are used to determine the size of your elements. The values can be expressed in 
pixels (px) and percentage (%). When working with static content using px is suitable as you will be defining 
your page to not change. If you are working with responsive design, you will want to use %.

Be careful when setting your height property as this will determine how much content the element can hold. If you 
leave it unset, your element will expand to fit the content it holds. If you set it and you have more content 
than can be displayed then you will need to either manually adjust the height each time you change the content 
or utilize the overflow property.

When you put width: inherit; then the object will inherit the width of the parent element. 

When you want your element to resize ie: images, you can size just one property (width or height) and the other 
will adjust appropriately to keep the relative dimensions of the image.

1em is the equivalent of 16px. 

a {
    width: 25px;
  }
  div {
    width: 100%;
    height: 200px;
  }
  img {
    width: 250px;
  }

  font-size:
  The font-size property values can be expressed in four different units pt, px, em, %. pt and px (point and pixel) 
  are considered static size values and will not adjust properly when resizing your page. em and % (responsive 
  measure and percent) however will resize and are what most developers recommend using. Below is a drop-down 
  chart showing the approximate equivalents between the four units.(**Note** not intended to update code)
  
  overflow:
This property determines what should happen when the content inside of a container is too much for the container 
size. You can set the container to hide the additional information that does not fit, show the information no 
matter what, or have a scroll bar added to the element so the content is contained but still viewable.

div {
    overflow: scroll;
  }

  background:
  The background property can modify the background of an element all in one line. This is a shorter version than 
  splitting each property on its own line of code. The color can be defined using hex, rgb or semantic code.

  p {
    background: #ffffff url("cherries.png") no-repeat fixed center;
  }

  background-color | background-image | background-position | background-size | background-repeat:
  These background properties adjust the background by property type. Like background, background-color can be 
  defined using hex, rgb or semantic code.

  p {
    background-color: blue;
  }
  div {
    background-image: url("cherries.png");
    background-position: center;
    background-size: auto;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
  }

  border:
  This property adjusts all border elements in one line. The first value is the border thickness. The second 
  value is the border type. The third value is the border color. The color can be hex, rgb or semantic code.
  
  The border property can also be broken down into separate lines using border-width, border-style and border 
  color. Additionally, you can select very specifically which border you want to style by using border-top, 
  border-bottom, border-right, border-left.

  button {
    border: 2px dotted green;
  }
  div {
    border: 1px solid #000000;
  }
  p {
    border-right: 1px groove rgb(100,100,100);
    border-left: 1px groove rgb(200,200,200);
  }

  border-radius
  This property allows the corners of your border to be given a rounded appearance. The values can be set 
  using px or %.

  button {
    border-radius: 5px;
  }

One problem with inline-block:
Note on margins and using divs. When you use divs, the extra whitespace between each div marker is interpreted on the screen ever so slightly. To
avoid these spaces, you would literally have to put the last </div> right next to the start of the new div <div>. 

FLEX:

Alternatively, you can use display: flex; You need to use this on the parent element (like container) then everything within it will use flex.
Note: the align-items: center; will prevent the columns from stretching (inhertiting the hgeight of the parent container div). 

Flex can also be used to position smaller elements (like images or boxes) within a larger element. Properties like align-items and justify-content 
can be used to position the elements exactly where we want them within some larger element.

At first when we apply display: flex; the image will appear distorted. Don't worry this is normal and we can fix this! 
When align-items is set it will "unstretch" our image.

justify-content:
Try out other values like:
flex-start (places images to the furthest left) 
flex-center (centers image) 
flex-end (places image furthest right)
space-between (puts space between images)
space-evenly (spaces images evenly)
space-around (put space around images)


The Flex Shorthand:
One of the most useful things we can do when using `display: flex;` is to make use of a shorthand property called flex!
This property combines: flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis and can provide an easy way for us to create columns in our layout.
You can also use terms like flex-1, which will make it so each element has an equal amount of the space 'pie'. 
Think of each element with flex: 1; like one slice of a pie. If another column were to have flex: 2, it will essentially take 
2 slices of the available space. For a live demonstration of this, see the embedded demonstration below. Try using the "Add Column" 
and "Remove Column" buttons and seeing how the columns resize themselves.

Flexible Math:
What would happen if we mixed in a div with the following "col-2" class? What about classes with flex: 3; or higher?
When we mix how many "slices of the pie" each of our columns ask for then we'll be able to mix in some larger columns. 
In those cases we'll need to add up the "slices" that are being asked for and use that at the basis for deciding the 
fraction of the row each column will receive.
What's best with all of this is the ease in setting up even columns as we don't need to figure out the exact width 
in pixels each column needs to take up and we don't have to factor in any padding, borders, or margins in those calculations.

Align-items:
Now use align-items to help the frogs get to the bottom of the pond. This CSS property aligns items vertically and accepts the following values:
flex-start: Items align to the top of the container.
flex-end: Items align to the bottom of the container.
center: Items align at the vertical center of the container.
baseline: Items display at the baseline of the container.
stretch: Items are stretched to fit the container.

***Justify-content and align-content functions switch when you move from row to column.

Flex-direction: 
This CSS property defines the direction items are placed in the container, and accepts the following values:
row: Items are placed the same as the text direction.
row-reverse: Items are placed opposite to the text direction.
column: Items are placed top to bottom.
column-reverse: Items are placed bottom to top.

CSS Resets
Different browsers may give default attributes to HTML elements, causing sites to look different based on the version of the browser or whether 
you're seeing the site in IE, Firefox, Chrome, etc.  For example in Internet Explorer, an H1 element may have certain margin and padding causing 
your site to look one way, while Chrome and Firefox may give the H1 a slightly different margin/padding.  These differences can cause a headache, 
especially if you're trying to make your site look consistent throughout different browsers/versions.

To solve many cross-browser issues, it's encouraged that you use 'RESET' and 'NORMALIZE' (discussed below) and, basically, define what the 
default attributes should be (instead of relying on the default values that come with the browser).  In fact, technical recruiters love to 
ask you about this and see if you know how to make your site look consistent throughout different browsers.  When they ask you this, you 
should be able to explain (with confidence) what reset/normalizing means and why they are used.  You should also tell them that in addition 
to this, it's important to validate your HTML/CSS often, as validating the HTML/CSS gives insight on how you can fix issues that may lead 
to cross-browser compatibility issues (and often, invalid HTML/CSS can lead to weird behavior as the browser may not 'fix' invalid HTML/CSS 
quite the right way).

Simple CSS reset
The simplest CSS reset that web developers commonly use is to simply zero out the margin and padding for all visible elements on the page. 
This will make our designs consistent from one browser to another and allows us to then specify padding and margin on only the elements where 
they will be necessary.

* {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}
More on CSS Resets
Here is a great explanation of what CSS resets are, why we use them, and some examples:
http://perishablepress.com/a-killer-collection-of-global-css-reset-styles/


Position: 
You can use the following position options: position: absolute; position: fixed; and position: relative;. Be very limited in your use of 
position: limited; because it will drive you crazy. 

Lego Concept:
The Lego concept is a way to visualize the different elements in your website as lego pieces. You want to put the big blocks down first 
and then place smaller blocks inside of them. By focusing on the big blocks first, you can think of the general layout of your website. 
After placing the big blocks, you determine which smaller boxes will exist inside of the bigger boxes and position them accordingly. It 
might seem faster to look at a screenshot and start coding HTML/CSS right away but drawing out the different lego pieces on the whiteboard 
first (bigger ones first, then smaller ones) will help you construct HTML/CSS more quickly.
