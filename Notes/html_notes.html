HTML Notes

*HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the main markup language for all web pages. HTML elements are the basic building-blocks of the internet.

*Objectives
Understand the theoretical components of the web and how they interact
Understand the client-server model
Understand the most important parts of what is displayed on the browser
Understand the roles of HTML vs. CSS vs. Javascript
Understand how to incrementally break down building a web page into its fundamental components

*What is HTML
HTML is the language of the Web. It stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

Its purpose is to let us communicate with the browser the meaning of the content that we wish to place on a web page. To achieve this, HTML defines a number of tags that we can wrap the contents with.

Headings and paragraphs of text
Images
Links
Lists
Tables
Forms
HTML has pre-defined tags for each of these, which we will cover in the following tabs.

HTML tags describe the content they contain. For example, there are paragraph tags for paragraphs, anchor tags for links, etc. The browser does not display the HTML tags but uses the tags to interpret the content of the page.

*Why HTML and CSS
The HTML and CSS chapters are designed to take you through the theoretical components of the web as well as the first step in creating a web application (building out the client-side). When building a web application we believe it is best to always start with a clickable prototype involving only HTML, CSS, and Javascript so it is only natural to teach these technologies first.

Create a Simple HTML Document
Create a new file in the Text Editor of your choice
Type "Hello World!" into the file
Save the file as hello_world.html
Drag the file into your browser to open it
That's it! You should see the text "Hello World!" displayed in your browser.

Now, you may have noticed that we didn't add any tags to our text. To see how the browser handles this situation, right click in your browser and click Inspect. A new module should open at the bottom of your browser with various tabs.

We're currently interested in the Elements tab. When you click on it, you should see:

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    Hello World!
</body>
</html>
copy
In the case where your HTML document isn't "valid", the browser will try to add appropriate tags to fix it.

One of each of <html>, <head>, and <body> above are required for each valid HTML document.

Some terminology here:

*Opening and closing tags
Since tags are supposed to wrap things, most tags come in pairs: one opening and one closing tag, that denote the beginning and end of content. Tags without a leading forward slash are called opening tags while tags with leading forward slashes are called closing tags.

In the above example, <body> is an opening tag - it's equivalent to you telling the browser "Hey, I'm going to start putting in body content now". </body> is a closing tag that means "OK, I'm done with body content."

*Nesting
Notice that between the opening and closing HTML tags, we also have head and body tags.

Tags can encapsulate other tags. This is called nesting. Nested items are indented with a tab to make the document easier to read.

The hierarchy that rises from nesting is called DOM - Document Object Model.

*Commenting
The format for commenting in an HTML file is as follows:

<p> Some paragraph content. </p>
<!-- This is a comment -->
The short cut for doing this on any given line is by typing Command and /. 

copy
Quick Start
To quickly get started editing an HTML document, we will first want to make sure we have created an HTML file in Visual Studio Code. We can do this by naming the file with a "dot html" at the end along the lines of index.html.

*Next we can generate the boilerplate HTML code using a handy shortcut ! followed by TAB.

*Syntax
Every HTML web page is composed of elements, which specify different types of content. The syntax for indicating the type of element is with tags. A section of content is wrapped in a tag, where the content begins with an opening tag (<element_name>) and ends with a closing tag (</element_name>). (There are a couple of exceptions--a handful of tags don't have closing tags.)

HTML has a finite, pre-defined list of tags that browsers will recognize. The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses the tags to interpret the content of the page. HTML tags describe the content they contain. For example, there are paragraph tags for paragraphs, header tags for headers, etc.

*Common Elements
Here are some common elements. On the left is how we'd write them in code, and on the right is how that code would be displayed in the browser!

*Headers: <h1> through <h6>

<h1>Most important</h1>
<h2>h2</h2>
<h3>h3</h3>
<h4>h4</h4>
<h5>h5</h5>
<h6>least important header</h6>copy
Most important
h2
h3
h4
h5
Least important header

*Paragraphs of text : <p>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a second paragraph.</p>copy
This is a paragraph.

This is a second paragraph.

*Hyperlinks (anchor tags): <a>

Important attribute: href (the url to route to)

<a href="http://login.codingdojo.com">Learn Platform</a>copy
Learn Platform

*Emphasis and Strong: <em> and <strong>

<strong> and <em> are often used inside of paragraphs <p>

<p><em>This</em> is an <strong>example!</strong></p>copy
This is an example!

Lists and Tables
Here are some more elements. On the left is how we'd write them in code, and on the right is how that code would be displayed in the browser!

Unordered (bullet) lists: <ul> with nested <li> that contain the list items

<ul>
    <li>Dog</li>
    <li>Cat</li>
    <li>Dragon</li>
    <li>Monkey</li>
</ul>copy
Dog
Cat
Dragon
Monkey
Ordered (numbered) lists: <ol> with nested <li> that contain the list items

<ol>
    <li>Dog</li>
    <li>Cat</li>
    <li>Dragon</li>
    <li>Monkey</li>
</ol>copy
Dog
Cat
Dragon
Monkey
Tables: <table> with nested <tr> (table rows) that contain nested <th> or <td> for header or regular data cells, respectively

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Movie</th>
        <th>Year</th>
        <th>Rating</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Up</td>
        <td>2009</td>
        <td>PG</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The Matrix</td>
        <td>1999</td>
        <td>R</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Movie	Year	Rating
Up	2009	PG
The Matrix	1999	R
Parent, Child, Sibling
In the code examples above, tags like <li> or <td> are always used inside of other tags like <ul> or <tr>. When an HTML tag is nested inside of another tag, we call the inside tag a child of the outer tag. Adjacent child tags like the multiple <li> are considered siblings of each other.

*More Elements
Here are some more elements. On the left is how we'd write them in code, and on the right is how that code would be displayed in the browser!

*Images: <img>

Important attributes: src (the image file path) and alt
Example:
<img src="panda.jpg" alt="panda pic">copy
panda pic (if not found; otherwise, image will be shown)

*Videos: <video>

Important attributes: src (the video file path) and controls
Example:
<video src="monkey2.mp4" controls></video>copy
More about videos

*If we want a video to autoplay on modern browsers, we need to include autoplay, loop, and muted.
Example:
<video src="monkey2.mp4" autoplay loop muted></video>

*Why Indentation?

In this chapter, we will be covering 2 very important concepts: proper  Indentation and the Parent, Child, Sibling Relationship.

Consider the following example:

                                                                            Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit? 
         Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Sed, ipsam placeat earum fugit sapiente unde blanditiis porro recusandae dolor! Dolorem quisquam deleniti earum aspernatur voluptas fugit dignissimos doloremque pariatur ipsum! Animi quo molestiae omnis iure suscipit cum, autem, illum debitis voluptates dicta alias mollitia provident est perspiciatis minima aspernatur ratione tenetur, neque ab accusamus quis.
Notice how the header is centered in the middle of the page. Also notice that the first word at the beginning of the paragraph is indented a few spaces over.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h3>Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit?</h3>
        <p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Sed, ipsam placeat earum fugit sapiente unde blanditiis porro recusandae dolor! Dolorem quisquam deleniti earum aspernatur voluptas fugit dignissimos doloremque pariatur ipsum! Animi quo molestiae omnis iure suscipit cum, autem, illum debitis voluptates dicta alias mollitia provident est perspiciatis minima aspernatur ratione tenetur, neque ab accusamus quis.</p>
    </body>
</html>
copy
Wait. Isnt it supposed to be indented like below?

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
   <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Document</title>
   </head>
   <body>
                                   <h3>Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit?</h3>
                <p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Sed, ipsam placeat 
        earum fugit sapiente unde blanditiis porro recusandae dolor! Dolorem quisquam deleniti earum
        aspernatur voluptas fugit dignissimos doloremque pariatur ipsum! Animi quo molestiae omnis iure
        suscipit cum, autem, illum debitis voluptates dicta alias mollitia provident est perspiciatis 
        minima aspernatur ratione tenetur, neque ab accusamus quis.</p>
   </body>
</html>
copy
Simple answer, NO. 

Remember, we don't indent our code by our website's  content, we indent them via the HTML tag's parent, child, sibling relationship. So how did we get the title centered? Good question! That'll require some CSS and we'll be learning all about positioning tomorrow. For now, just understand that indentation is determined by the PCS relationship, not by how we want the HTML to be visually rendered on the browser.

What is the HTML PCS Relationship?
The PCS relationship is just a term to describe the relationship between tags/elements inside an HTML document. To know the relationship between tags, we must first determine the parents, children, and siblings within our HTML document.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title> Hello World! </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1> Here is a heading tag </h1>
        <p> Now a paragraph tag </p>
    </body>
</html>
copy
From the HTML above you can read:

<html> is the root element
<html> has no parents
<html> is the parent of <head> and <body>
<head> is the first child of <html>
<body> is the last child of <html>
and:

<head> has one child: <title>
<title> has one content (text): "Hello World!"
<body> has two children: <h1> and <p>
<h1> has one content (text): "Here is a heading tag"
<p> has one content (text): "Now a paragraph tag"
<h1> and <p> are siblings
<head> and <body> are siblings

Is it really required to indent HTML code?
It's not required, but it is highly recommended, and here are the reasons why:

Beautiful-looking code can make you happy, and one way to make them look beautiful is to properly indent them.
Properly indented code leads to less time spent on troubleshooting. Imagine being stuck with a problem, and you curse the inventor of HTML (damn you, Tim Berners-Lee!) -- only to find out that you just missed a closing tag. You were not able to quickly see it because you did not properly indent! 
It's easy to browse through your own code. With a glance, you know right away which part is the header part, and which part is the footer.
It's a good coding habit. Popular programming languages such as PHP, Java, or Ruby recommend proper code indentation. Python even enforces it.
How to Indent
Just tap the TAB key. 1 TAB is equal to 4 spaces. 

When inserting an image into html, make sure to do a ./ before the file path you want to insert. If you try to put your computer file path
it will not work, particularly for anyone else trying to view your page. 

The <div></div> element exists for us to create a division in our code where we can group tags that have a common purpose together.

Example of form data and use of divs:

<form action="/process" method="post">
    <div>
        <label>Name: </label>
        <input type="text" name="name" 
        placeholder="Your name..." >
    </div>
    <div>
        <label>Email: </label>
        <input type="text" name="email" 
        placeholder="Your email..." >
    </div>
    <div>
        <input type="checkbox" name="offers" 
        id="offers" checked >
        <label for="offers">I would like 
        to receive email offers!</label>
    </div>
    <input type="submit" value="Sign Up!" >
</form>

Constantly Validate Your Code!:

- While writing HTML, make a habit to validate frequently; this will save you from issues that are harder to pinpoint (or redo) once your work is completed and lengthier.
- HTML validation services such as the free  W3C Markup Validation Service are useful debuggers that help you identify rendering errors.

Organize HTML Syntax:

- As your HTML gets bigger, managing it can become quite a task. Below are quick rules that can help you keep your syntax clean and organized:
- Use lowercase letters within element names, attributes, and values.
Indent nested elements. 
- Use double quotes, not single or completely omitted quotes to store in values for HTML attributes. Good example:

Make Use of Semantic Elements:

- Deciding which elements to use to describe different content may be difficult, but these elements are the backbone of semantics.
- Note: Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages rather than merely to define its presentation or look.

Button: 
There are two ways to do a button.
1) <button onclick="clicked ()">Name of Button</button>
    function clicked () {
        alert (" button clicked")
    }
2) <input type="submit" name="" id="" value="button name">

Navigate Panel:
To have navigate choices at the top of a page, use the tags <nav>  </nav>

CSS Box Model:
- In terms of priority in over-riding style prefences in CSS, inline is first, then in-header, then external.
- When styling, you always start top, right, bottom, left. 
- Margin, border, padding, content
- It always starts at 1200. 4 clockwise, 3 top, left, right, bottom, 2, top, bottom, left right.

All web layouts are accomplished with block elements. Designers use blocks, most often <div> elements, 
to create rectangular areas into which all content fits. There are only three rules:

1) Total area: the space an element occupies and affects.
2) Float, clear and overflow
3) Nested elements

Total Area:
Total width is how much horizontal space a block occupies. This includes the block’s margin, border, and padding. Calculating width, padding, and margin is often the biggest headache for designers, but it's easy to see how they work if you use the box model.
The box model consists of the properties margin, border, and padding.

Margin is outside block elements, while padding is within them. This means that we use margin to separate 
a block from things around it, and padding to move a block's content away from its edges.

We can specifically set the margin, padding, or border of any side of an element.
div{
    padding-top: 10px;
    padding-right: 10px;
    padding-bottom: 10px;
    padding-left: 10px;
  }

This (long-hand version):
div{
    padding-top: 25px;
    padding-right: 50px;
    padding-bottom: 75px;
    padding-left: 100px;
  }

Is the same as this:
div{
    padding: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
  }

Also, this:

div{
    padding-top: 25px;
    padding-right: 50px;
    padding-bottom: 25px;
    padding-left: 50px;
  }

Is the equivalent to this:
div{
    padding: 25px 50px;
  }

And this:
div{
    padding-top: 25px;
    padding-right: 25px;
    padding-bottom: 25px;
    padding-left: 25px;
  }

Is equivalent to this:

  div{
    padding: 25px;
  }

(The order flows clockwise, top -> right -> bottom -> left.)

Now, according to the box model, the total width of an element is:

(Margin x 2) + (Border x 2) + (Padding x 2) + Content Width

Calculating the height is trickier. Why? Because vertical margins collapse.

Ex:

HTML:
<div id="box-1">
</div>
<div id="box-2">
</div>
<div id="box-3">
</div>

CSS:

#box-1, #box-2, #box-3{
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    background-color: red;
  }
  #box-1{
    margin: 20px;
  }
  #box-2{
    margin: 30px;
  }
  #box-3{
    margin: 40px;
  }

When the vertical margins of two elements are touching, only the margin of the element with the largest margin value will be honored, 
while the margin of the element with the smaller margin value will be collapsed to zero.

There are other situations where elements do not have their margins collapsed:
-floated elements
-absolutely positioned elements
-inline-block elements
-elements with overflow property set to anything other than visible (They do not collapse margins with their children.)
-cleared elements (They do not collapse their top margins with their parent blocks bottom margin.)

Inline and Block:
We may have noticed when working with our HTML that some elements allow other elements next to them and others take all of the space next 
to them regardless of how much content they have. The ones that take up all of the space are called "block" and the ones that share space 
are called "inline".

The way to use this is by writing: display: block;

Inline-Block:
If we want to be able to change the width and allow the elements to be next to one another we have a third option "inline-block".
Inline seems really cool, but inline elements will shrug off our attempts to apply width to them.

We can make use of this to create columns on our webpages like so...
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>

CSS:
p {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 160px;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: lightcyan;
    margin: 10px;
}

NOTE: we need to ensure that the width of each individual column is narrow enough they will fit within their parent element... 
often a div or the body tag. Just applying inline-block won't ensure the elements are the size we want.

What if we have columns that don't all have the same amount of content?
[picture here where the tables are next to each other but they are lined up on the bottom and not from the top down and it looks weird]
Notice how they don't all line up at the top but instead seem to line up at the bottom. This is the default vertical-align behavior for 
inline-block and we can fix it by applying a different setting... vertical-align: top. While we could try fixing this with margins or 
use of the position property, vertical-align is the best approach.
