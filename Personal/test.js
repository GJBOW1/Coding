x = [5,4,3,2,1]
x[1] = x.length - 2
console.log(x)


//line 3 is setting the variable x to an array or list of numbers.
//line 4 is setting the first position within the x array to be the length of the array minus 2
//when you console.log the x variable, you will get the updated x array with the new change.
